# dotfiles-common/lib

This directory contains reusable Nix library functions used throughout the dotfiles.

## Imports (`imports.nix`)

- `mapRec { node, mapf }`: Walks a directory of `.nix` files recursively and maps each
  leaf with a function. A leaf is either a `.nix` file or a directory containing
  `default.nix`.
- `importRec node`: Imports a directory of `.nix` files recursively as an attribute set.
- `importRec1 node a`: Imports a directory of `.nix` files recursively, passing the
  argument `a` to each imported file.
- `callPackageWithRec pkgs node`: Like `lib.callPackageWith` but for an entire directory
  of packages. The packages are imported with their file basename as the attribute name
  and returned as an attribute set.

## Text (`text.nix`)

- `textRegion { name, content, comment-char ? "#" }`: Annotates a region of multi-line
  text with begin/end markers. Useful for identifying the origin of blocks in generated
  configuration files.

## Agents (`agents/`)

For a comprehensive guide to the MCP server configuration schema, see [agents/README.md](agents/README.md).

- `agents.mcpServersForAgent agent value`: Transforms a generic `mcpServers`
  attribute set mapping into configurations specifically formatted for a particular AI
  coding agent (e.g., `vscode`, `claude`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `opencode`, `antigravity`). Resolves mutually
  exclusive properties (like `command`, `serverUrl`, `headers`) and outputs them
  according to what each agent accepts. See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for full schema details.
- `agents.mkSkill pkgs { name, version, src, subDir ? null, include ? null, exclude ? null }`: Creates a Nix
  derivation containing AI coding agent skills. It searches the source path for directories containing a `SKILL.md`
  file, optionally filtering them via `include` and `exclude` lists, and copies them to the output path.
  - `pkgs`: Package set providing `stdenvNoCC`.
  - `name`: Derivation name (`pname`).
  - `version`: Derivation version.
  - `src`: Source directory containing skills.
  - `subDir`: Optional subdirectory within `src` to search. Defaults to `"skills"` if it exists, otherwise the root of `src`.
  - `include`: Optional list of skill names to include. If `null` or omitted, all discovered skills are included.
  - `exclude`: Optional list of skill names to exclude.
